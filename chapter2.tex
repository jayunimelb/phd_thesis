\chapter{Maximum Likelihood Estimator}
\label{ch:MLE}
\section{Overview}
Cosmic Microwave Background photons are lensed by the intervening galaxy cluster. 
The distortion imprinted on the CMB by the cluster is directly proportional to the total mass of the cluster.

In literature, we find different methods available to extract the lensing signal from the CMB data.
This chapter is organised as follows: in section one, I introduce Maximum Likelihood Method (MLE) used to extract the lensing signal.
followed by comparision of MLE with other cluster lensing estimators.
