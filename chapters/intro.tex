\textbf{Expanding Universe} 
\\In 1929, Hubble observed a trend that higher the redshift of Galaxy farther it is or put in an another way farther the galaxy away from us it recedes faster. This formed the first observational evidence for expanding Universe, a host of other observations since then have strengthened the arguments that Universe is growing larger.
\\Einstein in his General theory of relativity of proposed field equations which specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by matter and energy content in the Universe:
$$G_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}T_{\mu \nu}$$

These set of coupled non-linear equations can be solved under the assumption of Cosmological Principle. Which states that the Universe on the larger scales is homogeneous and isotropic.
