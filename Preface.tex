While this thesis is substantially my own work, it also contains the work that has been done in collaboration with colleagues. 
This section describes the publication on which some of the chapters are based.

\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter 1 and 2 comprises a fully referenced literature review of the standard model of cosmology. Both the chapter have been written by me.
\item Chapter 3 explains the Maximum Likelihood Estimator and is based on the work presented in the following publication\\ 
\citet*{raghunathan17a}. \\The lensing pipeline and simulations were generated by Srinivasan Raghunathan. I did the validation of pipeline and quantified the systematic biases due to redshift uncertainty.
\item Chapter 4 is based on the following publication\\ \citet*{raghunathan18}. \\I did the analysis using the simulations, applied it to the real data, and obtained the posterior probability distribution. In addition to that I quantified the bias due to our assumption of underlying cosmology and wrote the draft of introduction, data, results and conclusion work of the section.  
\item Chapter 5 is based on:\\ \citet*{patil19}.
\\ I developed the new method to suppress the major foreground in lensing analysis, generated the simulations to validate the newly developed method, forecasted the mass uncertainties future surveys will achieve. I also wrote the entire draft with suggestion from Christian Reichardt and Srinivasan Raghunathan.
\item Chapter 6 is entirely written by me. It summarizes all the work done during thesis and also sheds some light on future direction of CMB-cluster lensing.
\end{itemize}

In addition to the above mentioned publications I have also been actively involved:
