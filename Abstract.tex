The accelerating expansion of the Universe remains one of the biggest problems in fundamental physics. 
 It is often attributed to "dark energy", a new form of matter with negative energy. 
Galaxy clusters are one of the most sensitive probes of dark energy because their abundance depends on the rate of structure growth and the expansion rate of the universe. 
In addition that being the largest and most recently collapsed objects in the Universe galaxy clusters provide powerful constraints on matter density, matter fluctuation amplitude, and sum of neutrino masses.
 While clusters are one of the most powerful probes of cosmology they are currently limited by systematic uncertainties in their mass estimation.
 Gravitational lensing is one of the most promising technique to measure cluster mass, it directly probes the total matter content of the cluster. 
 The gravitational lensing source can either be optical galaxies or the cosmic microwave background (CMB). 
 
 
 This thesis focuses on developing statistical and mathematical tools to robustly extract the cluster lensing signal from CMB data. 
 We developed a maximum likelihood estimator to optimally extract cluster lensing signal from the CMB polarisation and temperature data. 
 We quantified various source of systematics tha
